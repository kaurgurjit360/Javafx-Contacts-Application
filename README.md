# Javafx-Contacts-Application
I used JavaFx to create a Contacts application in JavaFx. I store the contacts information in an ObservableList of Contact object. A contact contains first name, last name, email and phone number properties. When the user selects a contact from the contacts list, its information displays in a Grid of Text Fields.  As the information is modified (A Contact’s data is updated, a new Contact is added or an existing Contact is deleted), the contacts ListView displays the updates. The ListView on the side displays the Contact’s last name. I also provide a custom ListView that display’s the Contact’s full name and picture with the names sorted by last name.
